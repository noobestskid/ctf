This one is really tricky
the chall require you to figure out that
there is something interesting about the ICMP packets
(probably by the mass amount of malformed packets of the same source 
and destination)
Missing this clue, i got stuck
Then you also have to notice that the malforming of them is caused by
a single byte that is used to define the type of the ICMP packet
After you extract all these bytes using a script then you will find out that
it is a gif(reading the first few bytes)
