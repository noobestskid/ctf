checked it is not vulnerable to sql injection
found something interesting when i submit the form
a post request with the username and password i entered combined to 
be part of the requested url is sent 
the response told me that the user doesnt exist
so i tried DUNGEON_MASTER as the username and it worked
this time the response changed to telling me that the 
test hash doesnt match with the real hash
i tried using another password for the username and the test hash changed
so obviously the test hash is the hashed password
now i just have to figure out what the password is from that youtube video...
