I found the arbitary file access of the website but i missed a big part
of the chall
Although i noticed that what i need is somewhere inside the server but i dont 
know the exact location of it 
I checked the /etc/passwd but i didnt notice the tftp server thingy which deviated
me completely and making me randomly guessing the directory
After some fruitless attempts i decided to look into the ftp server
(given by the chall) of it and ofcourse i found nothing 
so i got stuck

If i was aware of what tftp is then i would still have to look up
the default directory of the tftp config file
In the config file i would get the root directory of the tftp server
which is obviously related the CoinGame from the folder's name
Even if i got to here, it is very possible for me to get stuck again
because i would not be able to acess all the files without knowing the names
so i will probably look for any way to list the directory(which can be hard
 only using the arbitary files acess vuln as far as i know) unless i did 
the following

The final step is to search for the name
of the creator of the site and find out his git repository
Having this clue then it should be pretty straight forward that the server is holding 
the newest version of the game that hasnt been pushed to the git yet
so i would have to jot down all the files and folders in the git repository
and download them in the tftp server and look for any difference
with the git command diff
