from the title of this question
we know its about local file inclusion
the website of this question is built using wordpress
a free and open source content-management system
the hint mentioned "wpscan"
after googling, this is an automanted tool aimed at finding all the 
vulnerabilities of a wordpress built website
by using the tool to scan the site
we know that the site is using SAM pro free
an advertisements-managing plugin 
but most importantly is that the version of it is outdated
and there is a documented vulnerability about it which will allow us to do lfi
the php file in the directory 
"/wp-content/plugins/sam-pro-free/sam-pro-ajax-admin.php"
accept user inputs without checking and load the according file
after googling
we know that there are two parameters we have to provide 
"action" and "wap"
by putting action=NA&wap=thedirectoryofthefiletoacess
notice that the directory we provide to the wap must first be
encoded in base64
the question provided us the directory of the file
that is "/var/www/blah.php" so we know it is located in the root of the server
so we simply have to encode the directory "../../../blah.php"
and provide it to the wap parameter
and the flag will be displayed
