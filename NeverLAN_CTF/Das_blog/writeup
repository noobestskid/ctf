the website in the question is a blog that allow us to login
taking a look at the source code
we get the username and password of a test account
after we log in
we found something interesting about the cookies
there are a total of three cookies
"PHPSESSID=9mbh7ovnpvrqglsh761fo9n2f4; user=JohnsTestUser; permissions=user"
we tried to change the value of the permissions cookie to "admin"
and boom nothing happended
the page login.php still show us that we are with user permission
but when we changed the web page the root of it
it showed that we are with admin permission and the flag is there
