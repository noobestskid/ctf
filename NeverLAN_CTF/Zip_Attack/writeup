this is a known plaintext attack of zip files
we have a zip archive encrypted and another zip archive but not encrypted
what is interesting is that the unencrypted archive contains file that is
the same in the encrypted one
after googling 
we can decrypt the encrypted archive and get the flag.txt using a simple 
programme named pkcrack
