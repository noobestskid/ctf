use wireshark to filter out all except http packets
sort it according to time
look for the "401 unauthorized" and the respond packet of it
401 status code means there is authorization credentials needed to acess 
the requested page
which means a username and a password should be the in respond packet
also we can see that the authentication scheme used here is basic
it means that base64 is used to encode the credentials
recover it by decoding the credentials in the respond pack and you find 
the flag
