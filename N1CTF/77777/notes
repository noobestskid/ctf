curl --data "flag=1111&hi= where 'name' not like '77777'" http://47.75.14.48 > temp

in the given site
we can see numerous tabs
in which one of them we are given a php source code
which is highly suspectible to being vulnerable to sql injections
due to the fact that the query string take up to two user inputs from post request
one is added to the query as digit and the other is as string
the string one is being filtered before adding to it
the original query is an UPDATE command
it doesnt return anything but only allow us to change the column 'points' in the table 'users'
the only thing that we see changes with different post request is the html element 'score points'
we dont know how many users are there
so we should somehow put admin's password in the column such that the html element can output the flag
this can be done using subquery with the original UPDATE query

!!! the user of the score that is being displayed on the website is not 77777
